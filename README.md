<h3><b>CHATBOT: A Comparative Analysis</b></h3>


This project focuses on the development and evaluation of an AI-driven chatbot capable of comparative analysis across different models trained on two distinct datasets: Mental Health and Customer Support. By fine-tuning pretrained language models such as GPT-2, RoBERTa, and BERT on these datasets, the project aims to assess their performance in understanding and generating responses tailored to each domain. Through experimentation and evaluation, the project aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of various model architectures and training strategies for tasks involving mental health conversations and customer support interactions.
